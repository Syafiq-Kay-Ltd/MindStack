            <h2>I learn. I build. I question. I explore. And I’m glad you’re here.</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Syafiq. I’m a pharmacist working in London, but my interests stretch much wider—from healthcare and law to systems, science, and computing. This site is my little lab for ideas: part journal, part testing ground, part quiet rebellion against sticking to just one thing.</p>
            <p>If you enjoy learning across boundaries, building things thoughtfully, or just following curiosity wherever it leads—you’re in good company.</p>

        <section id="capabilities">
          <h2>What I do, and how I think.</h2>
          
          <p>I design modular systems, write clean and purposeful code, and ask questions that reach beyond the clinical. As a community pharmacist, I’ve seen healthcare at its limits—when patients struggle to reach their GPs or turn to private services out of necessity. These moments shape how I approach systems, not just in medicine, but across technology, policy, and everyday life.</p>
          
          <p>Alongside clinical work, I build web apps, explore workflows, and study how disciplines like law, ethics, and computing shape the world around us. My approach blends structured thinking with curiosity across domains.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Here’s what powers my work:</strong></p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pharmacy & Clinical Insight:</strong> Grounded in day-to-day care, I see both the fragility and the resilience of healthcare systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Multidisciplinary Curiosity:</strong> From science and maths to law and tech—I draw connections across boundaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Modular Development Philosophy:</strong> I favour clean, scalable architecture with reusable components and clarity of purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Research & Systems Thinking:</strong> I explore how ideas scale and interact—always zooming out before drilling down.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Platform & Public Impact:</strong> This site is both a reflection and an invitation—open to anyone curious about how things fit together.</li>
          </ul>
